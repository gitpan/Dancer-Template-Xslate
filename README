NAME
    Dancer::Template::Xslate - Text::Xslate wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Text::Xslate module.

    In order to use this engine, use the template setting:

        template: xslate

    This can be done in your config.yml file or directly in your app code
    with the set keyword.

    You can configure Text::Xslate:

        template: xslate
        engines:
          xslate:
            cache_dir: .xslate_cache/
            cache:     1
            extension: tx                     # Dancer's default template extension is "tt"
            module:
              - Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like # to keep partial compatibility with Template Toolkit

CAVEATS
    Cascading
        Dancer already provides a <cascade>-like feature, called a "layout",
        in order to augment other template engines lacking such a feature.
        In order to use Xslate's "cascade", turn off "layout" by commenting
        out or removing the appropriate line in your Dancer application
        config.

    Smart HTML Escaping
        Use of Dancer's "layout" feature will cause HTML templates to be
        HTML-entity encoded twice if Xslate's "smart HTML escaping" feature
        is enabled. Xslate's "type" option can be set to "text" to disable
        smart-escaping, or, once again, "layout" can be disabled in favor of
        "cascade".
